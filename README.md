# ML-Supervised-Learning_Classification-Model-Development

Built various predictive models to determine the explanatory variables that best explains the response variable. 
Models used for analysis: 
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classification (KNN)
- Classification Trees
- Random Forest (Classification)
- Gradient Boosted Models (GBM)
